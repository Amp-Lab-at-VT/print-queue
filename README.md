# 3D Printing in the Amp Lab

## Rules of the Road

1. Amp Lab members will take priority in the print queue
2. No print that has been started will be stopped unless it meets the following criteria:
- The print was started inappropriately/was unauthorized
- The print is failing and needs to be re-started
3. Amp Lab mentors will manage the 3D printers and the print queue. Should a mentor elect to print a submitted file, they will assign themselves to the issue and start the print
4. No training for the 3D printers is currently offered. Only mentors will have direct access to the printer
5. Finished prints will be left in the Amp Lab next to the printer. The GitHub issue will be updated with a completion status, and it will be the resposibility of the requestor to pick up the part. Parts not picked up within 10 days will be recycled.
6. If a part is picked up from the lab before a mentor is able to handle removing it from the bed of the 3D printer, the student should log that the part was picked up by closing the issue ticket. **Students should take caution when doing this, as removing it with careless force can damage the printer and print bed. Such actions are cautioned**
