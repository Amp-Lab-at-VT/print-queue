# 3D Printing in the Amp Lab

## Rules of the Road

1. Amp Lab members will take priority in the print queue
2. No print that has been started will be stopped unless it meets the following criteria:
- The print was started inappropriately/was unauthorized
- The print is failing and needs to be re-started
3. Amp Lab mentors will manage the 3D printers and the print queue
4. No training for the 3D printers is currently offered. Only mentors will have direct access to the printer
5. Finished prints will be left in the Amp Lab next to the printer. The GitHub issue will be updated with a completion status, and it will be the resposibility of the requestor to pick up the part. Parts not picked up within 10 days will be recycled.
